      <h1>About the 3T Game</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the 3T Game, a fun and interactive project that I've
        developed as my mini project! This classic game is a perfect way
        to showcase my programming skills and passion for game development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective of 3T is simple: two players take turns to mark
        spaces in a 3x3 grid, attempting to form a line of three of their own
        marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's a game of
        strategy and quick thinking!
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless
        and enjoyable gaming experience. It's a great example of my ability to
        combine front-end technologies to build interactive web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're reliving the nostalgia of your childhood or experiencing
        the game for the first time, I hope you enjoy playing this version of
        3T. Feel free to share it with your friends and family!
